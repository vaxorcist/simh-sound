=================
Collection of ideas and thoughts on the implementation of the SIMH sound project.

ENABLE/DISABLE SOUND
--------------------
- Global sound setting at the computer level: SET SOUND ENABLED|DISABLED (Default: ?), overwrites all specific settings
- Specific sound setting at the device type level, e.g. device RL: SET RL SOUND|NOSOUND (Default: ?) 
  or at the device level, e.g. device RL0: SET RL0 SOUND|NOSOUND (Default: ?)

Sound types and names
---------------------
a) Disk drives (d = disk, xxxx = drive type; e.g. rl02)
d_xxxx_switchon
d_xxxx_fan
d_xxxx_spinup
d_xxxx_spinidle
d_xxxx_access_short
d_xxxx_access_medium
d_xxxx_access_long
d_xxxx_spindown

Several device types still need to be added

Sound file type
---------------
must be SDL2-supported; not decided upon yet
