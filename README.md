#  SIMH sound project

This is a fork of the [SIMH computer simulator](https://github.com/open-simh/simh), trying to add real or realistic sounds from disk drives and other computer devices to the simulation.

Works starts with the DEC RL02 removable disk pack drive (because I've got two of them).

I would very much appreciate if owners of other classic computer devices would contribute sound samples of their devices, preferably, but not exclusively DEC components.

Following a most-wanted list:
- RK07
- any classic DEC 9-track tape drive
- RM03
- RP04
- RP05
- RM80
- RP06
- RM05
- RP07
